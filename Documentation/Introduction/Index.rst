What does it do?

It converts a normal URL to a tiny URL. It works similar as services provided by https://bitly.com/
or http://tinyurl.com/ .

It has multiple integration options. You can create tiny URLs in the backend by adding a tiny URL
database record. You can convert any typolink to a tinyurl by simply adding some configuration
options. And you can use the API of this extension to create tiny URLs in your own extensions.
